title: Ingame Overlay

# Start the overlay
Once the kernel driver has been successfully loaded, and CS2 is up and running, 
you can start the Valthrun overlay by running `controller.exe`.
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a terminal window looking like this:

With these steps completed, you are now ready to use Valthrun and take advantage of its gameplay enhancements for Counter-Strike 2.
You can access the overlay by pressing the `PAUSE` key. If you do not have such key please refer to [Open the GUI without a PAUSE key](../../troubleshooting/overlay/pause_key)

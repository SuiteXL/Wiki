# Contributing to the valthrun kernel driver
Currently the kernel driver is private.  
Use the prebuild kernel driver available within the github releases.
  
The base for the kernel driver started open source and is still available within the commit history. As I've added more and more in depth features as manual mapping support and basic stelth features I decided to make its code base private. One of many reasons is that I may use this driver for other game- / reverse engineering- based projects.
